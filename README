Spur
====

Spur means:
- anything that goads, impels, or urges, as to action, speed, or achievement. 
- a short branch track leading from the main track, and connected with it at one end only

This is a barebones starter web application to get new ideas and projects quickly off the ground.  Similar to the Rails way of providing an opinionated framework for the web application, Spur is an opinionated starter application.  Several plugin and structure decisions are made to cover the foundation of the application, effectivly removing the "CRUD" of application startup.

The initial idea is to provide:
- Basic Plugins
- Login System
- Static Page setup
- Basic Navigation
- Admin User option in navigation

Plugins Included
================
- shoulda
- restful-authentication (had to rename to restful_authentication)
- make_resourceful
- exception_notification
- haml
- aasm
- action_mailer_tls (allows sending email through Gmail)

TODO
====
1) User Maintenance (for user)
2) Users Maintenance (for admin)
3) Change password (part of 3/4?)
4) Write tests for new code

New Spur Clone for working on THIS project
==========================================
1) Go to your project directory
2) git clone git@github.com:jayshepherd/spur.git
3) cd spur
4) git submodule init
5) git submodule update
6) Copy or create a database.yml and modify for your environment
7) rake db:create:all
8) rake db:migrate
9) rake test (make sure you have a test database in database.yml)
10) Modify config/environments/development.rb with your mailer and constant settings

New Application Installation Instructions
=========================================
1) Clone project
2) Rename/move
3) Push to github or whatever source control
4) Create/modify database.yml for your app
5) Change the REST_AUTH_SITE_KEY value in config/initializers/site_keys.rb
6) Add config/initializers/site_keys.rb to the .gitignore file
7) rake db:create
8) rake db:migrate
9) rake db:fixtures:load
10) Modify app/models/user_mailer.rb for your site
11) Modify config/environments/development.rb with your mailer and constant settings

Misc Notes
==========
1) Might have to configure mail settings for your needs for authentication emails to work
2) "Home" page is pages/index 
3) Be sure to change REST_AUTH_SITE_KEY in config/initializers/site_keys.rb or you may have the same key as other apps derived from this project.  When you do this, it will break the passwords that are already in the users.yml file in test/fixtures, so be prepared to reset their passwords.
