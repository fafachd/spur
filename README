Spur
====
This is a barebones starter web application to get new ideas and projects quickly off the ground.  Similar to the Rails way of providing an opinionated framework for the web application, Spur is an opinionated starter application.  Several plugin and structure decisions are made to cover the foundation of the application, effectivly removing the "CRUD" of application startup.

The initial idea is to provide:
- Basic Plugins
- Login System
- Static Page setup
- Basic Navigation
- Admin User option in navigation

Plugins Included
================
- shoulda -> done
- restful_authentication -> done
- make_resourceful -> (Which one?)
- exception_notification -> done
- haml -> done
- others?

Installation Instructions
